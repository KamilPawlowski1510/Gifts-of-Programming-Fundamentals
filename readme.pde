Brief description of the animation achieved:
I made a couple of Christmas presents highlighting different things we learned in our lectures

Known bugs/problems:
-The cursor cannot change into the arrow cursor when on a present because when the cursor is on one present it is not on another so they request contradictory things (arrow cursor and pointer cursor)
-It is hard to click on the back arrow in the Gift of Text because of the delay function
